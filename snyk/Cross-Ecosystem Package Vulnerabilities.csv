"Interesting(?): Cannot find much on the BSDs vulnerabilities, so we cannot report. But we can say we observe packages present in ecosystems we don't have in the dasea dataset, e.g. the OS stuff + cocoapods, therefore they do potentially spread accross ecosystems? However, we need to address that issue with vulnerabilities info scattered amoung various sources, or not available for the smaller ecosystems (Clojars, BSDs, Alire, etc.)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
